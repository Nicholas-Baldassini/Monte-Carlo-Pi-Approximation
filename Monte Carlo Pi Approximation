Pi can be approximated by calculating the ratio of the area of a circle
to a square.

If we have a circle of radius r enclosed by a square of side-length 2r, if
we accurately the area of the circle along with the square and divide the circle
by the square and multiply by 4 we can achieve an approximation of Pi.

However, the current formula for area of a circle is Pi*r^2 but since we are
calculating Pi we can not use it the formula for the area of the circle, so
the method to approximate the area of the circle and square is by generating
random points in the square and counting how many happen to be in the circle and
divide the two numbers as both numbers would be approximations of the are of
the circle and square.
